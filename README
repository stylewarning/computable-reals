                       =======================

Computable real numbers x are interpreted as (potentially) infinite
fractions in base 2 that are specified through a rule for computation
of an integer a with |(2^k)*x - a| <= 1 for any k>=0.

The internal data structure should not be accessed.
The interface for the outside world is as follows:

The type CREAL is a supertype of the type RATIONAL. (CREAL-P x), for
an object x, returns T if x is of type CREAL, otherwise NIL.

(APPROX-R x k), for a CREAL x and an integer k>=0, returns an integer
a with |(2^k)*x - a| < 1.

(MAKE-REAL fun) returns the real number given by fun. Here fun is a
function taking an argument k, that computes a as above.

CREALs are output by print etc. as a decimal fraction. The error hereby
is at most one unit in the last digit that was output. The number of
decimal digits after the decimal point is defined through the dynamic
variable *PRINT-PREC*.

For comparison operations etc. a precision threshold is used. It is
defined through the dynamic variable *CREAL-TOLERANCE*. Its value should
be a nonnegative integer n, meaning that numbers are considered equal
if they differ by at most 2^(-n).
