;;;; The code below can be used freely under the following conditions:
;;;; * Due credit is given to the original author.
;;;; * You use it at your own risk. The code is experimental and meant
;;;;   as a case study to show that "lazy reals" can be implemented.
;;;;   In particular, no guarantee is given that the code conforms to
;;;;   the specification given below.
;;;;
;;;; If you use it in publications (including software), please let me
;;;; know.
;;;;
;;;; Note: The main focus here is on correct results (which are, however,
;;;; not guaranteed, see above). It is certainly possible to improve the
;;;; efficiency of the code quite a bit.
